List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags>

<a> (Anchor Tag):-  
           The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks or links within an HTML document.
           It allows you to link to other web pages, documents, or specific sections within the same page.
           It requires the "href" attribute to specify the destination URL or target location
      example:-<a href="https://www.pwskils.com">Visit Example Website</a>

<h1> to <h6> (Heading Tags):
             Heading tags are used to define headings or titles of different levels on a webpage, 
             from <h1> (the highest level) to <h6> (the lowest level).
        example:-<h1>Main Heading</h1>
                 <h2>Subheading</h2>

<img> (Image Tag):
             The <img> tag is used to insert images into an HTML document.
             It requires the "src" attribute to specify the image source (URL or file path). 
            It can also include attributes like "alt" (alternative text), "width," and "height"
        example:-<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the Image">
